## ADMIN SIDE - Game form page example
An example of how to add a game to the database (only for administrators).
For this, we check that it does not exist by looking for it in the dropdown, and we add the name, description, then we upload the main image and add the stockings that the game will contain, to finish we select the categories to which it belongs, with this we will already have the game added , now, it still won't show up because there is no platform that is selling it, so let's add it to a platform.

## ADMIN SIDE - Category form page example
In this form the categories are created and edited, in the following example, you will see how I select an already created one and edit it, changing its name and removing a game..

## ADMIN SIDE - Plataform form page example
This could be the most complex form, as you can see, here we create/edit the platforms, adding a name, URL and their logo, then, to add games to it, we select one from the dropdown list, and then the data fields that relate the platform and the game are enabled, we edit them and click on the "add game" button and it will be added to the list, once the game is on the list, you can remove it from it or edit it to _change the price/etc_, **IMPORTANT for a game to appear, it has to be related to a platform and enabled (the green button next to save game)**. When we finish we press "Save all" and we can go to verify that it exists.
