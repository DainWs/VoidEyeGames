## Description
Final project for 2ÂºDAW, its a website is intended for support in the search for the best offers and alternatives when buying video games. In addition, together with the detailed description of the video games that will be made through videos and images, you will find the different links to purchase websites and a series of comments written by users. They will also be able to report bugs to developers and view the location of our company on a map. In short, a page that helps customers to see on which page it is sold at the best price and the different prices at the time to buy video games. **Remember that games cannot be purchased on this page, since its purpose is consultation, and not the purchase of video games.**

## Important!! - SSL Certs not included
As you can understand, I can't provide application passwords/credentials/certificates, as this could bring security issues, for this project you can only run it in DEVELOPMENT mode (using `npm start` command), Yes even if you want to be able to put it into production, access the `.crt` folder in the project root folder, (relative path from which this file is located is: `../.crt`, if the folder does not exist, no hesitate to create it) in that folder you will save the server.crt and the server.key (the certificates)
